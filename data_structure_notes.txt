DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LINEAR AND NON-LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES:
    I. Linear Data Structure - data structures where the data elements are 
    arranged sequentially or linearly where each element is attached to its 
    previous and next adjacent is a linear data structure. 
        > They are single level, which means we can traverse all of the 
        elements in a single run. 
        > They are easy to implement because the computer memory is arranged
        in a linear way. 
        > Ex) array, stack, queue, linked list, hash tables, etc. 


    II. Non-Linear Data Structure - data structures where data elements are 
    not arranged sequentially or linearly are non-linear data structures.
        > These are not single level. Therefore, we can't traverse all of the 
    elements in one single run. 
        > It utilizes computer memmory efficiently in comparison to a 
        linear data structure
        > Ex) trees, graphs, hash tables
