Linear Search Introduction ----------------------------------------------->
    > The linear search algorithm checks whether a value is an element in 
    a list by scanning the elements of a list one-by-one.

    > It's iterative approach to finding a target value is useful in solving
    search problems with unsorted data. 


Implement Linear Search -------------------------------------------------->
    > Linear search is used to search for a target value in a list. Each 
    element is compared against the target value until the matching
    value is found. 

    > If a match is found, the linear search function will return the index
    of the matching element. Otherwise, a ValueError will be raised to denote
    that the matching value was not found. 

    > The pseudocode for linear search is:
        # For each element in the search_list
            # if element equal target value then
                # return its index
        # if element is not found then
            # raise a ValueError


Finding Duplicates ------------------------------------------------------->
    > We can modify the pseudocode to find multiple targets in a list:
        # For each element in the search_list
            # if element equal target value then 
                # Add its index to a list of occurences
        # if the list of occurences is empty
            # raise ValueError
        # otherwise
            # return the list occurences


Finding the Maximum Value ------------------------------------------------>
    > In order to find the maximum value, we must sequentially scan the 
    entire list for the largest value that we have seen to date.

    > We can modify the pseudocode as such:
        # Create a variable called max_value_index
        # Set max_value_index to the index of the first element of the list
            # For each element in the search list 
                # if element is greater than the element at max_value_index
                    # Set max_value_index equal to the idx of the element
        # return max_value_index
