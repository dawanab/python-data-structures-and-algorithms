# Swapping Elements in A Linked List 
    > Given a LL and the elements to be swapped (val1, val2), we need
    to keep track of four values:
        1. node1 - the node that matches val1
        2. node1_prev - node1's previous node
        3. node2 - the node that matches val2
        4. node2_prev - node2's previous node

    > Given an input of a LL, val1 and val2, the pseudocode is:
        1. Iterate through the list to look for the node that matches
        val1 to be swapped (node1), keeping track of the node's previous 
        node as you iterate (node1_prev)
        2. Repeat step 1 to find the node that matches node2 
        3. If node1_prev is None, node1 was the head of the list: 
            > set the list's head to node2
        4. Otherwise, set node1_prev's next node to node2
        5. If node2_prev is None:
            > set the list's head to node1
        6. Otherwise, set node2_prev's next node to node1
        7. Set node1's next node to node2's next node
        8. Set node2's next node to node1's next node
