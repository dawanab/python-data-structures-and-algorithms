Creating the Hash Map Class ------------------------------------------------->
    > Hash Maps are efficient key-value stores. The underlying data structure 
    used is an array. A value is stored at an array index determined by 
    plugging the key into a hash function.

    > For real-world use cases in which a key-value store is needed, Python
    offers a built-in hash table implementation with dictionaries. 

Creating the Hashing Function ----------------------------------------------->
    > A hashing function takes a key and returns an index into the underlying
    array. They need to be fast to compute. 

    > The encode() method converts a string into its corresponding bytes, 
    a list-like object with the numerical representation of each
    character in the string

Creating the Compression Function -------------------------------------------->
    > Hashing functions return a wide range of integers. We need to turn these
    into useful indicies for our array by using a compression function. 

    > A compression function uses modular arithmetic to calculate an array index 
    for a hash map when given a hash code
