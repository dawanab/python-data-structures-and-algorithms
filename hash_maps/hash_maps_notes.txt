Hash Maps Introduction ---------------------------------------------------->
    > Hash maps key their related values, and they are one of the most 
    efficient data structures as it realtes to retrieving stored data. 
    > They are efficient because they key associated with every value allows 
    for faster retrieval later on. 
    > They are best used when you're solving problems where you have to both
    store and retrieve data

Tables -------------------------------------------------------------------->
    > A data structure's main utility is to have data structured in a way that 
    represents how people will use that data. 
        ** In some cases, the primaryfunction of that data is to be traversed 
        through like a list, so we use a data structure that allows for easier
        iteration, like a linked list.
        ** In other cases, the usefulness comes from specifying interrelationships
        within the data 
        ** For example, a table with only two columns, represents a special
        relationship that some call a "map". 

Maps ----------------------------------------------------------------------->
    > Being a map means relating two pieces of information, with another 
    requirement:
        ** When speaking of a map, we describe inputs as the keys to the map
        ** We refer the output is the value at a given key 

    > In order for a relationship to be a map, every key that is used can only 
    be the key to a single value; there doesn't need to be a value for every 
    possible key, there just can't be more than one value for a given key
