Hash Maps Introduction ---------------------------------------------------->
    > Hash maps key their related values, and they are one of the most 
    efficient data structures as it realtes to retrieving stored data. 
    > They are efficient because they key associated with every value allows 
    for faster retrieval later on. 
    > They are best used when you're solving problems where you have to both
    store and retrieve data

Tables -------------------------------------------------------------------->
    > A data structure's main utility is to have data structured in a way that 
    represents how people will use that data. 
        ** In some cases, the primaryfunction of that data is to be traversed 
        through like a list, so we use a data structure that allows for easier
        iteration, like a linked list.
        ** In other cases, the usefulness comes from specifying interrelationships
        within the data 
        ** For example, a table with only two columns, represents a special
        relationship that some call a "map". 

Maps ----------------------------------------------------------------------->
    > Being a map means relating two pieces of information, with another 
    requirement:
        ** When speaking of a map, we describe inputs as the keys to the map
        ** We refer the output is the value at a given key 

    > In order for a relationship to be a map, every key that is used can only 
    be the key to a single value; there doesn't need to be a value for every 
    possible key, there just can't be more than one value for a given key

Hash Map Methodology -------------------------------------------------------->
    > With a map, we don't care about the sequence of the data, we only care 
    that a given input gives the accurate output; however, computers care more 
    about values than relationships, so we have to trick the computer
    
    > We trick the computer by using a structure that it's already familiar with:
    an array; an array uses indices to keep track of values in memory, so we need 
    to turn each key in our map into an index in our array 
        ** In order to do this, we use hashing functions; A hash function is useful 
        in many domains, but for data structure, the most important aspect is that 
        a hashing function returns an array index as output 

Hash Functions --------------------------------------------------------------->
    > A hash function takes data as input and returns an array index as output
    > In order for it to return an array index, our hash map implementation needs 
    to know the size of our array. 

    > The hash function needs to first compute a value using some scoring metric:
    this is the hash value, hash code, or just the hash 
    > The implementation then takes that hash value mod the size of the array 
    > Hash functions are also known as compression functions; because of this, 
    hashing is not a reversible process

Basic Hash Maps --------------------------------------------------------------->
    1. First, we need some sort of associated data that we're hoping to preserve 
    2. Secondly, we need an array of a fixed size to insert our data into 
    3. Lastly, we need a hash function that translates the keys in our array into 
    indexes into the array; the storage location at the index given by a hash is 
    called the hash bucket 

Collisions -------------------------------------------------------------------->
    > It's likely that our hash function might produce the same hash for two 
    different keys. This is known as a hash collision
        > One way to resolve hash collisions is separate chaining; this strategy avoids
        collisions by updating the underlying data structure. Instead of an array of 
        values that are mapped to by hashes, it could be an array of linked lists

Separate Chaining -------------------------------------------------------------->
    > If the value of the array at the hash function's returned index is empty, a new 
    linked list is created with the value as the first element of the linked list.
    If a linked list already exists at the address, append the value to the linked 
    list given 

Saving Keys --------------------------------------------------------------------->
    > A hash resolution strategy like separate chaining involves assigning two keys 
    with the same hash to different parts of the underlying data structure
    > If we save both the key and the value, then we will be able to check against 
    the saved key when we're accessing data in a hash map. By saving the key along 
    with the value, we'll be avoiding having two keys with the same hash code where 
    we might not be able to distinguish which value goes with a given key 

    > When we read or write a value for a key we would do the following:
        1. calculate the hash for the key 
        2. find the appropriate index for that hash
        3. begin iterating through our linked list
    > For each element, if the saved key is the same as out key, return the value; 
    otherwise, continue iterating through the list comparing the keys saved in 
    that list with our key 

Open Addressing: Linear Probing  -------------------------------------------------->
    > Another hash collision strategy is open addressing
    > In open addressing, we stick to the array as out underlying data structure, but 
    we continue looking for a new index to save our data if the first result of our 
    hash function has a different key's data 

    > A common open method of open addressing is called probing.
    > Probing means continuing to find new array indicies in a fixed sequence until
    an empty index is found 

Other Open Addressing Techniques ------------------------------------------------->
    > quadratic probing open addressing system - avoids clustering 
    > Clustering is what happens when a single hash collision causes additional 
    hash collisions

REVIEW: 
Hash map: A key-value store that uses an array and a hashing function to save and retrieve values.
Key: The identifier given to a value for later retrieval.
Hash function: A function that takes some input and returns a number.
Compression function: A function that transforms its inputs into some smaller range of possible outputs.

Recipe for saving to a hash table:
- Take the key and plug it into the hash function, getting the hash code.
- Modulo that hash code by the length of the underlying array, getting an array index.
- Check if the array at that index is empty, if so, save the value (and the key) there.
- If the array is full at that index continue to the next possible position depending on your collision strategy.

Recipe for retrieving from a hash table:
- Take the key and plug it into the hash function, getting the hash code.
- Modulo that hash code by the length of the underlying array, getting an array index.
- Check if the array at that index has contents, if so, check the key saved there.
- If the key matches the one you're looking for, return the value.
- If the keys don't match, continue to the next position depending on your collision strategy.

1. What does the collision strategy called Open Addressing do when it finds a collision?
    > Looks for another cell in the underlying array to add the value to 

2. How does a hash map turn the hash code for something into an array index?
    > Using the modulus operator, usually via a compression method
